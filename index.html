        <h1>Poem of my Dogs</h1>
        <h3>By Parker Madrigal-Geary</h3>
        <p>My dogs are very small, they are only <em>weenie dogs</em></p>
        <p>We got them when I was in sixth and we've had them ever since</p>
        <p>Ones name is <strong>Berkley</strong> and the other is <strong> Raider</strong>, although we never have one in favor</p>
        <p>Recently we got another dog named <strong>Bella</strong>, she is a huge dog at only 2 years old</p>
        <p>she likes to dig up plants and play fetch</p>
        <p>together they even each other out</p>
        <p>some crazy some calm</p>
        <p>despite that they still bond</p>
        <p>they are my group of dogs</p>
        <p>and i wouldnt change it</p>
